What changes you made to the script(s)

I changed linearVelocity to velocity so the movement would work

I added a flip so the footballer faces the right way when moving

I added a reset if the player falls off the watermelon platforms

Challenges you faced

One challenge I faced was trying to make the win script work when the player touches the flag. I also had trouble figuring out how to add all the components correctly in Unity, like the Rigidbody2D and Colliders.

How you solved them

I asked for help and used Unity’s tags and collision system to detect when the player touches the flag. I also watched a tutorial to understand what components I needed for the objects to work properly.

What you’re most proud of in your game so far

I’m most proud that I created a full level with a football player jumping on watermelons and reaching a flag. It works, and it looks good with the football background.
